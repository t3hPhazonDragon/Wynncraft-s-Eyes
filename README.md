###CUSTOMIZATIONS

Extra customizations to the pack can be found in:

	assets -> minecraft -> customizations

To use one of these, you'll want to copy the corresponding files to the correct folder in the pack. The name of the folder the customizations are found in correspond to the folder that they should be moved to.

The originals from the pack are also in the customizations section, so you don't have to worry about losing or replacing files if you do choose to use these.

These customizations are typically extras that I've made and decided to later change or completely redo, such as the fonts and the ice.
